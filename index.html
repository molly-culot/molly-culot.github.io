        My name is Molly Culot, I am seventeen years old and a senior at Tappan Zee High School, located in Rockland County. 
        I started programming my freshman year by taking the entry level classes offered at my school. In my sophomore year, 
        I joined every computer science related extracurricular my school had to offer. This year, I have taken on many 
        leadership roles in these activities, which has helped me become a leader within my community. I am continuing to help 
        grow the computer science program in my school by encouraging other students to learn about programming, and promoting 
        STEM to younger grades by showing them projects I have worked on. <a href = #Robotics>My favorite project that I am currently working on is 
        a program that helps students located in Sub-Saharan Africa access STEM related education.</a> I initiated and currently manage a robotics program
        at St. Thomas Amagaro Girls Secondary School in Amagaro, Kenya. It’s so rewarding to share my love of programming with those who 
        wouldn’t otherwise have access to it. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing the guitar, tennis, skiing, and working my part-time 
        job at Starbucks. Fun fact: I programmed this website by teaching myself HTML and CSS!

        I strive to be a leader within my community, and because of that, I took on many leadership roles within my school this year. 
        I became president of the Computer Science Club, Project Manager of the Robotics Team, and treasurer of the Computer Science 
        Honor Society. As the president of the Computer Science Club, I created the first in-person alumni series and invited past 
        computer science students to come in and talk about their job and college experiences to prepare current high school students 
        for the transition into college and adulthood. This year, I ran the club’s annual events, Codecon and SOTech night. During 
        CodeCon, we all went to the middle school and showed students what computer science is all about. There were many expositions 
        of coding, robotics, and other interesting aspects of computer science. For that night, I programmed a game in Java where middle 
        school students went through a series of riddles to unlock a set of locks. SO Tech night is a similar event but for elementary 
        school students. I presented the robot at this event, and also created a game the children played called Carl, a platformer game 
        where students could make him jump, move, and other simple mechanics meant to showcase programming. I was the announcer at this 
        event and made sure all kids went to every station they were supposed to be at. My school began a local hackathon in 2022, where I created 
        the gold questions. In 2023, as president of the Computer Science Club I created new gold questions for the hackathon
        and helped run the event.

        I became a representative for my grade in the principals council, a small focus group that works with the principal and discusses

        discuss events held within the school. As a delegate, I helped raise money for people-to-people, and raised over $300.00 with my 
        group. My senior year, I was elected to be the vice president of Student Organization, where I help plan pep rallies, fundraisers,
        and all other major school events.

        STAGGS Robotics Team in Amagaro, Kenya
      </div>
      <div class = "textCenter">
        In October 2022, I attended a meeting with members of Kiwimbi Global, an organization dedicated to providing education to 
        students located in Sub-Saharan Africa. As Project Manager of the robotics team, SO BOTZ, I worked amongst a small group to 
        connect our team, Kiwimbi Global, and St. Thomas Amagaro Girls Secondary School. I initiated and currently manage a robotics 
        team at the school. To begin this collaboration, my team donated Scratch workbooks and VEX robots to their local community 
        center and library. At St. Thomas, we helped the teachers develop their own robotics club. To assist them through the process, 
        I continuously update a website with tutorial videos made by members of the team and myself. I stay in contact with the teachers through whatsapp 
        at the school and pay attention to a question box on the website, where students can ask questions or request specific tutorials 
        to be created. On the website, I created videos teaching them how to create a google drive account and a scratch account. With 
        these tutorials, they were able to send their first emails to my account, where they discussed how thrilled they were for the 
        program and the progress they had made at that point. I run a meeting with them virtually every other Saturday to congratulate 
        them on their progress, help them however is necessary, and continue building a strong relationship with the students. At the 
        first meeting, I created a game to play with the students to help them practice critical thinking skills that are a necessity 
        in computer science. The students seemed to be reluctant to join in, and weren’t used to an environment where they could speak up. 
        However, these students have come a long way. At meetings, they are eager to learn, speak, and are endlessly appreciative of the 
        robotics program we helped create. It is so rewarding to see how far they have come, and I have faith this team will continue for 
        many years to come. They began attending regional science fair competitions in March of 2023, where they showcase their robot and 
        give a presentation about what they have done on the team. At their first local competition, they won first place and were ecstatic 
        with their progress. Shortly after on March 12th, I was invited to speak as a representative of my team virtually at the 67th NGO 
        CSW Forum, which was a virtual event that focused on the empowerment of women and hosted by one of the main UN organs within the 
        United Nations, the UNCSW. I was able to talk about my experience working with the students in Amagaro and how it impacted my life 
        as well as their lives. Our Forum focused on women helping women, and spreading opportunities across the world. They continued this 
        success and won their regional, county, and national competition.

        Project Management

      <div class = "textCenter">
        In my junior year, I was selected to be the project manager of the robotics team. In this position, I worked 
        to turn my team into a <i>FIRST</i> Impact team that strives to be an environment of learning, camaraderie, and teamwork. I work hard 
        to make my team a place where all members feel comfortable asking questions and have a passion for what they are doing. It is 
        important that members are offered new opportunities, try new things, and are all given tasks they are eager to complete and have 
        an interest in. I have meetings with the software, build, design, and finance/marketing leads every Monday to keep the team organized 
        and on the same track. I plan to continue being a project manager until I graduate, and mentor <i>FIRST</i> teams in the future.

        Software

      <div class = "textCenter">
        My robotics team programs in java using the WPI libraries provided by <i>FIRST</i>. During the Rapid React competition in 2022 I began 
        researching and programming color detection for red and blue colored balls using a REV robotics color sensor. Over the summer 
        going into the 2023 season, I created a basic drivetrain tutorial that walks new members through the process of programming using 
        the WPI libraries, VS Code, and Github. It teaches them step by step how to run motors in a program, use joystick inputs, and 
        implement subsystems into commands. In the 2023 season, Charged Up, I worked on a vision program that uses a limelight. It 
        has the capability to detect reflective tape and april tags using different pipelines. The program allows the robot to autonomously 
        use commands to align with targets, drive to a specific distance away from the target, and detect alignment.

        During this competition, I went through training to become the coach of the drive team. During the 2022 preseason, our team 
        attended two competitions where I was able to put this training into action, and was able to coach the drive team to get first 
        place in the Raritan Valley Robot Rumble.  Throughout the 2023 season, I will coach the drive team at three regional competitions 
        and train younger members to take over my position when I graduate.
