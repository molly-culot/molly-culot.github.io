        My name is Molly Culot, I am sixteen years old and a junior at Tappan Zee High School, located in Rockland County. 
        I started programming my freshman year by taking the entry level classes offered at my school. In my sophomore year, 
        I joined every computer science related extracurricular my school had to offer. This year, I have taken on many 
        leadership roles in these activities, which has helped me become a leader within my community. I am continuing to help 
        grow the computer science program in my school by encouraging other students to learn about programming, and promoting 
        STEM to younger grades by showing them projects I have worked on. My favorite project that I am currently working on is 
        a program that helps students located in Sub-Saharan Africa access STEM related education. It’s so rewarding to share my 
        love of programming with those who wouldn’t otherwise have access to it. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing the guitar, 
        tennis, skiing, and working my part-time job at Starbucks.

        I strive to be a leader within my community, and because of that, I took on many leadership roles within my school this year. 
        I became president of the Computer Science Club, Project Manager of the Robotics Team, and treasurer of the Computer Science 
        Honor Society. As the president of the Computer Science Club, I created the first in-person alumni series and invited past 
        computer science students to come in and talk about their job and college experiences to prepare current high school students 
        for the transition into college and adulthood. This year, I ran the club’s annual events,  Codecon and SOTech night. During 
        CodeCon, we all went to the middle school and showed students what computer science is all about. There were many expositions 
        of coding, robotics, and other interesting aspects of computer science. That night, I programmed a game in Java where middle 
        school students went through a series of riddles to unlock a set of locks. SOTech night is a similar event but for elementary 
        school students. I presented the robot at this event, and also created a game the children played called Carl, a platformer game 
        where students could make him jump, move, and other simple mechanics meant to showcase programming. I was the announcer at this 
        event and made sure all kids went to every station they were supposed to be at.

        I became a representative for my grade in the principals council, a small focus group that works with the principal and discusses 
        what should be changed about the school. I am also a delegate in the Student Government, and attend weekly meetings where we 
        discuss events held within the school. As a delegate, I helped raise money for people-to-people, and raised over $300.00 with my 
        group.

      <div class = "textCenter">
        In October 2022, I attended a meeting with members of Kiwimbi Global, an organization dedicated to providing education to 
        students located in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this meeting, the one thing I noticed about their program was it was all based 
        around reading and writing and they had limited use of technology throughout their curriculum. I began to connect the robotics 
        team with their organization, and wanted to somehow incorporate STEM into their lessons. My team donated Scratch books to them, 
        allowing them to begin to create their own block programs. I created videos for them and organized them onto a website, teaching 
        them how to create google and Scratch accounts. I also had members of my team create videos to walk students through certain 
        problems in the books. Once they finish those, they will start programming VEX robots.  My ultimate goal is for their school to 
        eventually create a <i>FIRST</i> robotics team with assistance from my team. I meet with them on a video call every other Saturday to 
        answer any questions they may have, and help them however is necessary.

        I joined my high school’s <i>FIRST</i> robotics team, SO BOTZ, during my sophomore year and became a member of the software subteam. 
        During the robotics preseason of 2021, Infinite Recharge, I went to two different competitions where I fulfilled the role of 
        technician on our drive team. During the Rapid React competition in 2022 I began researching and programming color detection 
        for red and blue colored balls. I went to two regional competitions as the drive team technician, while simultaneously training 
        to become the coach of the drive team for the next year.

        turn my team into a <i>FIRST</i> Impact team that strives to be an environment of learning, camaraderie, and teamwork. I created training 
        modules for all new members of our software team to go through to teach them the code that we use for our robots, and to help them 
        learn how to be active members of our team. During the preseason, our team attended two competitions where I coached the drive team. 
        Under my guidance, we won first place in the Raritan Valley Robot Rumble.

        Western Highway, a local street in Rockland County, where turtles cross in order to lay their eggs. During the summer going into 
        my Junior year, I began an internship with the company ACUE, which is The Association of College and University Educators. Their 
        motto is "Student success through exceptional teaching." I most definitely agree with their motto, and strive to live by it, by 
        becoming a leader in everything that I choose to do in my life. They create modules for professors to follow to improve their 
        teaching and collaboration skills.

        I have been playing tennis since I was five years old. In my freshman year, I played second singles on the junior varsity team 
        for my school. In my sophomore year, I was accepted onto the varsity team where I played third doubles throughout the season. 
        In my junior year, I played first doubles on the varsity tennis team. In addition to tennis, I also was on the varsity golf 
        team in my freshman year. During the Winter and Spring, I love skiing in Vermont and Utah. I also have a background in performing. 
        I play the guitar in my free time and did two online performances for Rivertown Music. In 2022, I performed the national anthem at 
        the semifinals for high school basketball. I also love playing chess, and have been in the chess club since my sophomore year. From 
        May-December I work as a barista at Starbucks. This job helped me improve my communication and problem solving skills.
