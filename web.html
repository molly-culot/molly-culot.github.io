        <!--My name is Molly, and I am 16 years old in my junior year at Tappan Zee 
        High School. I love programming, but the one thing I love more is spreading
        my knowledge of computer science to anyone I can. I believe everyone should
        have the oppurtunity to learn how to program, no matter their age, gender, race, 
        or background. Having the knowledge of computer science can expand any interest, 
        and take it into the digital world. This is why I do anything I can to spread the 
        idea of STEM to all. I want to inspire young women to take on the challenges of
        programming and try to do it themselves. I have noticed a lot of girls getting 
        indimidated by the idea of taking computer science classes or joining computer
        science clubs. This is something I want to help change in the world.-->

        I joined my high school robotics team in the 2021 preseason when the competition was infinate 
        recharge. I attended two preseason competitions where I was the technician on drive team B 
        for the first one and the technician on drive team A for the second one. During the 2022 season,
        I assisted with programming different aspects of the robot including the serializer and the color 
        sensor. I was the technician for these compeitions. The following year, I was chosen as the 
        project manager for my team and I became a coach on the drive team.

        During my sophomore year, I took on my first internship as a web developer for the Turtles of Western 
        Highway and assisted them in any digital issues they had. During the summer, I began an internship with the 
        company ACUE, which is a program that teaches teachers how to become better at their jobs. I also work at
        a Starbucks as a barista. I began working there the summer going into my junior year, and have continued that 
        job throughout highschool.
