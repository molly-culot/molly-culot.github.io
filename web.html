        My name is Molly Culot, I am 16 years old and a junior at Tappan Zee High School. I started programmming
        in my freshman year, and made several applications in my free time. Going into my sophomore year, I joined
        every computer science related extra-curricular my school had to offer. Finally, in my junior year I continued
        to take on leadership roles in these activities, and starting some new ones of my own. When I'm not coding, 
        I enjoy playing the guitar, playing tennis, working at starbucks, and organizing.

        I joined my high school robotics team in the 2021 preseason when the competition was infinate 
        recharge. I attended two preseason competitions where I was the technician on drive team B 
        for the first one and the technician on drive team A for the second one. During the 2022 season,
        I assisted with programming different aspects of the robot including the serializer and the color 
        sensor. I was the technician for these compeitions. The following year, I was chosen as the 
        project manager for my team and I became a coach on the drive team.

        During my sophomore year, I took on my first internship as a web developer for the Turtles of Western 
        Highway and assisted them in any digital issues they had. During the summer, I began an internship with the 
        company ACUE, which is The Association of College and University Educators. Their motto is "Student success through
        exceptional teaching."
